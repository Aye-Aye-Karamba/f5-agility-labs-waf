Create Your 1st L3 IPI Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An IPI policy can be created and applied globally, at the virtual server (VS) level or within the WAF policy itself. 
Often, questions arise around what is the best way to implement. As always, the answer is; **it depends**. Implementing globally or at the VS level will provide the best 
performance and uses a separate log file for violations. This also keeps the actual WAF logs clean. When managing global or VS specific policy your security admins may not have this level of access to the BIG-IP. 
A WAF admin assigned **Application Security Administrator** rights on a BIG-IP can only modify WAF policies and can not see or make changes to the VS itself or the global IPI settings. This means the IPI policy would need to be managed inside of the WAF policy. 
When implementing within the WAF policy the blocking happens at layer 7 rather than layer 3 and any IPI violations will be in the WAF event logs with all the other alerts. By inspecting at Layer 7 we have the additional capability to scrutinize the XFF header. Another benefit of Layer 7 IPI is that the violations are fed into our event correlation reporting capabilties.

In this lab we will start by enabling a Global IPI Policy, then configure a VS specific profile with a custom category. 
We will also explore the configuration of IPI within the WAF policy itself. 

#. On the Main tab, click **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies**.

#. Click on the **Create** button. 

#. For the name:  **global_ipi** 

#. Under **IP Intelligence Policy Properties**: For the Default Log Action choose: **yes** to Log Category Matches

#. Browse to the inline **Help** tab at the top left of the GUI and examine the Default Log Action settings. Note that hardware acceleration is not available when logging all matches. 

#. Click **Add** under the categories section. 

#. From the category section choose **botnets** and click **Done editing**.

#. Repeat this process and add the following additional categories: **infected_sources**, **scanners**, **spam_sources**, & **denial_of_service**.

Apply Global IPI & Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to: **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies**.
#. Apply the **global_ipi** policy and click **Update**.

#. RDP to the client01 jumphost
#. Open a terminal and navigate to **/home/f5student/waf141/agility2020wafTools**
#. Run the following command to send some traffic to the site: **./ipi_tester**.

.. NOTE:: The script should continue to run for the remainder of Lab 1 & 2. Do NOT stop the script. 

#. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Network > Ip Intelligence** and review the entries. Notice the Geolocation Data as well as the Black List Class to the right of the log screen.

Create Custom Category 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to: **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Blacklist Categories** and click **create**.
#. Name: **my_bad_ips** with a match type of **Source**
#. Click **Finished**
#. Select the category name **my_bad_ips** and click **Add To Category**

.. image:: images/add_to_cat.png
  :width: 600 px

#. Enter the ip address: **134.119.219.71** and set the seconds to **3600** (1 hour)
#. Click **Insert Entry**

Create VS Specific L3 IPI Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to  **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies** and click **create**. 
#. Name: **webgoat_ipi**
#. For Default Log Action choose **yes** to log category matches. 
#. Under Categories click **Add** and choose the **my_bad_ips** custom category. 
#. Click **Done Editing** and **Commit the Changes To System**.

Create IPI Logging Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Logging Profiles** and click **Create**.
#. Name: **IPI_Log**
#. Select **Network Firewall** and **local-db-publisher** under IP Intelligence and then click **Create**.

.. image:: images/ipi_log.png

Apply IPI Policy and Logging Profile to VS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and click on **insecureApp1_vs**
#. Under the **Security tab > Policies** in the top middle of the GUI, enable the webgoat IPI profile and associated logging profile.
#. Click Update.

Verifying the Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Network > Ip Intelligence** and review the entries. You should now see Global and VS Specific Violations.

Create your first WAF Policy & Configure L7 IPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Navigate to **Security > Application Security > Security Policies** and click the Plus (+) button. 
#. Name the policy: **insecureApp1_asmpolicy**
#. Select Policy Template: **Rapid Deployment Policy**
#. Select Virtual Server: **insecureApp1_vs**
#. Notice that the enforement mode is already in **Transparent Mode** and Signature Staging is **Enabled**
#. Click **Save**.

#. Navigate to **Security > Application Security > Policy Building > Learning and Blocking Settings** and expand the **IP Addresses and Geolocations** section. Notice that **Access from malicious IP address** is set to **Alarm** and **Block**. We will cover these concepts later in the lab but for now the policy is still transparent so the blocking setting has no effect. 

.. image:: images/ipi_asm.png
  :width: 600 px

#. Navigate to **Local Traffic > Virtual Servers** and click on **insecureApp1_vs**.
#. Under the Security tab in the top middle of the GUI click on **Policies** and your policy settings should look like this. 

.. image:: images/policy_setting.png
  :width: 600 px

#. Disable the IP Intelligence Profile and enable the **Log all requests** logging profile as shown below, then click **update**. 

.. image:: images/policy_mod.png
  :width: 600 px

#. Navigate to **Security > Network Firewall > IP Intelligence > Policies** and disable the Global IPI profile and click **update**. 

.. image:: images/disable_global.png
  :width: 600 px

#. Navigate to **Security > Application Security > IP Addresses > IP Intelligence** and enable IP Intelligence. 
#. Notice at the top left that you are working within the insecureApp1_asmpolicy policy context. Enable **Alarm** and **Block** for each category. 
#. Click **Save** and **Apply Policy**

.. image:: images/waf_ipi.png
  :width: 600 px


#. Navigate to **Security > Event Logs > Application > Requests** and review the entries. You should now see IPI violations. If you browse to the site via Firefox on Client01 you should see good traffic as well in the event logs since we are logging all requests and not all IP's are malicious. 

.. image:: images/events.png

#. Click on one of the alerts and review the violation details. Note that you can see the entire request details even though this site was using strong TLS for encryption.

.. NOTE:: It is best practice to enable Trust XFF in the policy when configuring IPI via WAF policy. XFF inspection is one of the advantages to consider when deploying IPI and can only be done via WAF policy. Although this setting is not needed to demonstrate this lab, it is strongly recommended to have it enabled.

As you can see, there are several methods of configuring IP Intelligence on the BIG-IP and each has it's own pro's and con's. It will be up to you to decide which method works best for your organization but at least now you know and knowing is most of the battle in IT. 

**This completes Lab 1.1**
